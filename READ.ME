This program is a robust and interactive JSON processing utility that handles multi-line input seamlessly. It combines two powerful JSON formatting capabilities into a single tool while addressing real-world usability issues.

Purpose:
This program is designed to:

Convert multi-line, formatted JSON into a one-liner with escaped double quotes (\").
Restore a one-liner JSON (with escaped quotes) into a human-readable, multi-line JSON format.
Features:
Multi-Line Input Support:

Handles multi-line JSON input gracefully, allowing users to paste JSON directly from files or other sources.
Uses an iterative approach to read lines of input until EOF (e.g., Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z).
Two Integrated Tasks:

Task 1: Compresses formatted JSON into a compact one-line format with escaped quotes.
Task 2: Expands a compact one-liner JSON back into a readable, pretty-printed format.
Interactive and User-Friendly:

Provides clear instructions for both tasks and input methods.
Displays descriptive output for the selected task.
JSON Validation:

Ensures all input is valid JSON before processing.
Detects and reports errors with informative messages to guide the user.
Error Handling:

Handles invalid JSON input and informs users of specific issues.
Prevents crashes from malformed or incomplete data.
How It Works:
User Input:

The user is prompted to choose between two tasks:
Compress JSON into a one-liner with escaped quotes.
Expand JSON from a one-liner to a multi-line format without escaped quotes.
Accepts multi-line input until the user signals the end.
Processing:

Task 1:
Validates the JSON.
Converts it into a one-line string with double quotes escaped (\").
Task 2:
Removes escape characters (\) from the input.
Validates the JSON.
Formats the JSON with indentation for readability.
Output:

Provides a clear result based on the selected task.
Example Use Cases:
For Developers:

Simplify JSON for embedding in code or configuration files.
Debug or inspect compact JSON by expanding it into a readable format.
For Data Analysts:

Streamline JSON data for pipeline processing.
Expand JSON logs for easier analysis.
For System Administrators:

Convert JSON data between formats to suit different systems or tools.
Advantages:
Handles Complex Input: Works with both single-line and multi-line JSON input.
Interactive Design: Offers a simple menu-driven interface for easy operation.
Reliable and Error-Free: Includes robust validation and error handling.
Limitations:
Relies on valid JSON input; does not correct structural errors in JSON data.
Requires manual EOF signaling (Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z) for multi-line input.
Summary:
The program is a versatile, user-friendly JSON tool tailored for developers, analysts, and administrators who frequently work with JSON data. Its multi-line input support and robust error handling make it reliable for real-world tasks, whether compressing JSON for efficiency or expanding it for clarity.
